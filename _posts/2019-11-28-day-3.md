### What I plan to do tomorrow

Finish up the 201 review lab: RWD and SMACCS. Work on my hobby project with OAuth2 and React.

### Relection

I got a good review of jQuery functions, I couldn't remember them and spent some time in the documention for the functions I ended up using. Re-enforced the importance of documentation and quick, effective use of it.
