# Cookies, more cookies and jQuery

## What I worked on today
I'm confused about which day to frame these too, today is Thanksgiving, I think. So I had not done anything. Yesterday I switched all the DOM manipuation in Salmon Cookies to use jQuery.

## What I plan to do tomorrow
Finish up the 201 review lab: RWD and SMACCS. Work on my hobby project with OAuth2 and React.

## Relection
I'll reflect on yesterday beacuse I'm not going to be doing anything today. I got a good review of jQuery functions, I couldn't remember them and spent some time in the documention for the functions I ended up using. Re-enforced the importance of documentation and quick, effective use of it.
