# Fleshing out cache manager

### What I worked on today

Fleshed out functions in the cache/crud manager. Can save and lookup. Also going to do the cache invalidation through the JS rather than through the SQL, just because it seemed more fun to me.

### Link to commit

[Commit](https://github.com/david-vloedman/city-explorer-review/pull/3)
I haven't actually merged this pull request, I simply made it for submission. The manager itself is not complete.

### What I plan to do tomorrow

Finish up the caching module, apply it to the location and weather data I've already got working.

### Reflection

Been doing some application of a revealing module pattern, exposing on the functions I need to access and using out of scope ones to fulfill the exposed functions job.
