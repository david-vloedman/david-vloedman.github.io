# Cookies, OAuth & React
### What I've worked on today

I've been messing with OAuth2 and React, nothing too great yet. I got my new installion of Manjaro up and running and setup for class.
### PR Link

No PR for Salmon Cookies yet.

## What I plan to work on tomorrow

I'm going to start the process of swapping out all the vanilla js DOM maniupation for jQuery on the Salmon Cookies.

### What I learned:

I've learned the general JS class structure for React and some review on DOM manipulation.
