# City Explorer Begins

### What I worked on today

Started 301 review project, got some scaffolding up, dependencies and some initial work on server. Had to setup postgres on my new linux environment.

### Link to commit

[Commit](https://github.com/david-vloedman/city-explorer-review/commit/350ab6ae2fb53cc824b68120678f068c9b199db1)

### What I plan to do tomorrow

I'm going to get the geocoding working as well as the weather, possibly more if I have time and it goes well.

### Reflection

Got some good refreshing of starting a new NPM project, installing dependencies and setting up an express server.
