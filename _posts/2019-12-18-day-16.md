# Oh my blog

### What I worked on today

Nothing. Even forgot the blog post. You guys are killing me with the blog posts, I don't even turn on my computer some days and I'm busiest on the days these are due and less busy on the days they're not.

### Link to commit

Nothing to link to

### What I plan to do tomorrow

I'm getting a massage at 10 with my fiancee, celebrating my mother's birthday and while unlikely, maybe finish up the prework.

### Reflection

I find myself reflecting on how easy it is to miss a blog post.
