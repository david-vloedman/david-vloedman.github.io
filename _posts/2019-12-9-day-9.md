# Rushing to finish 301-review

### What I worked on today

I've had limited time to work, stuff kind of piled up being in class and now everyone is demanding I do stuff! Ridiculous. 
I got location working and checking cache before calling the api and weather partially there. I tried to make use of the cache module I made by using it for generating insert and select statements. 

### Link to commit

[Commit](https://github.com/david-vloedman/city-explorer-review)
No current PR, not a lot has been done since the last post due. 

### What I plan to do tomorrow

I've got two interviews tomorrow and I'm already super stressed out about them, so being an introvert my day will probably be wiped out with that. 

### Reflection

Not a lot to reflect on. Was reading about await/sync in hopes of clearing out the syntactic mess that is then. It's just a non-readable mess of anonymous functions and polluted namespace.
