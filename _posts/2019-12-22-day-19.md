# Cache Invalidation on review, lots of prework

### What I worked on today

I did the bulk of the prework for 401, worked a little on the 301 review project trying to finish it completely. It's hard to be motivated to work on that project.There is just so much about it I don't love.

### Link to commit

[Commit](https://github.com/david-vloedman/city-explorer-review/commit/4d86bc6f6870a3f8998e1c932b41f76483f83acb)
This is the commit for the work I've done on the 301 Review

### What I plan to do tomorrow

I hope I remember to do a blog entry. It's Christmas Eve and I'm staying out at my parents, I've been out here helping them with their property all break.

### Reflection

Working in the 301 Review project there is just so much that could be dry'd up. Even beyond the stretch goal of making a module for the SQL, there is so much that repeats itself. But with there being a pretty big amount of the code given to us in the original assignment it's hard to stray away from that design. I hope to be more keenly aware of what abstracted out into reusable code from the very beginning when planing my projects.
