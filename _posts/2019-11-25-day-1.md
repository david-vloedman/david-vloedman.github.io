# Day One
## Hello Devstation

Couldn't figure out how to link, still unsure if the theme will be applied to this page. I was able to get my index to work, but when linking to this particular post I have been unable to get it to apply the theme. The file name appears to be correct.

I'm spending Thanksgiving with my fiancee, her father and my family at my grandparents house- eating food and wanting to go to bed! I love to sleep.
